For the fulfillment of course requirement for Electronics Engineering student are required to do a project with considerable level of difficulty applying the theoretical knowledge acquired during the whole tenure of undergraduate studies. This is final report of the project. We have chosen to do a project in \gls{rtls}, based license trial automation system to improve the existing trial system in Nepal. We have first proposed this system to be applied for the trial automation for two-Wheeler motorbikes. In first phase, ultrasonic sensors are used to find the distance of the vehicle form  at least three predefined locations, then use trilateration to find the exact space co-ordinate referring to our local coordinate system. We have used ultrasonic sensors to find the distance of the object from three predefined locations. The next phase is to apply the positioning system to automate the trial system. There is a provision of graphical visualization of the process in an \gls{gui} application.
