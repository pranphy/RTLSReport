We would extend our sincere gratitude the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, for encouraging us to work on this project. We would also like to thank the department for providing us with a project room facilitated with an oscilloscope and function generator which really helped us to proceed in the project.

We would also like to thank our project supervisor Associate Professor Tika Upreti for encouraging us to complete the project and for providing us with his invalueable suggestions. Also we would like to thank all our friends without whose support this project would not have been possible.
