\section{Time frame}
	With limited time to complete the project, we have a rough sketch of how we commenced and planned to complete our project. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:GanttChart}, the total available time is divided into different periods and different works are and will done in the period.

	In Figure \ref{fig:GanttChart} the empty white boxes represent the work yet to be done, and the half grey filled box show the work progress till date. The completely filled boxes represent the work completed. The arrows connecting the boxes represent the sequence of works to be done.
